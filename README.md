### Yet Another Java Course
###### _Material for the Advanced Programming Course at the University of Tehran School of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science_
***
This repository will (gradually) contain codes ~~and exercises~~ for a basic Java course.
The topics will be straight forward and (are expected to) exhaust some basic ideas and concepts of _[Object-oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_oriented)_. However, the exact scope and depth of the presented subjects are determined by how far the students participate in the class. So all kinds of feedback, including opening issues or creating PRs are very much appreciated.
